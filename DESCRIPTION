Description: Interactive visualization for Bayesian prior and posterior distributions. 
             When both distributions are provided the animation shows a transition from 
             prior to posterior. Finally, the animation splits the distribution using the provided 
             'breaks' into bars that show the probability for each region. 
             If no 'breaks' are providers it will use zero by default.
